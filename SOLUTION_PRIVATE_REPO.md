# Solution 2: Make Repository Private (Immediate)

## Steps:

1. Go to: https://github.com/sridharankaliyamoorthy/agent404-proactive-csi/settings
2. Scroll to bottom: **Danger Zone**
3. Click: **Change repository visibility**
4. Select: **Make private**
5. Confirm

**Repeat for:** https://github.com/sridharankaliyamoorthy/Agentic_AI_test/settings

## ✅ Immediate Effect:
- All URLs become inaccessible to public
- Orphaned commits hidden from everyone except you
- IBM Security team won't be able to view the links

## ⚠️ Tradeoffs:
- Hackathon project not publicly visible
- May affect judging if they need public access
- Can make public again after GitHub purges commits

## 🔄 Temporary Solution:
1. Make private NOW (links disabled immediately)
2. Submit GitHub support request (wait 24-48 hours)
3. Make public again after GitHub confirms purge

---

## When to Use:
✅ Need immediate link disabling
✅ Can temporarily hide project
✅ Will make public again later

❌ Don't use if hackathon requires public repo
