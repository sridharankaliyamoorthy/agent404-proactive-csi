# 🔧 Cloudant Database Setup (Optional)

## Status

Cloudant data upload is **optional**. The agent can work with:
- ✅ CSV files directly (already available)
- ✅ Mock data (built-in)
- ⚠️  Cloudant (optional, for production)

## If You Want to Use Cloudant

### Option 1: Create Database Manually (Recommended)

1. **Go to IBM Cloud Console:**
   ```
   https://cloud.ibm.com/
   ```

2. **Navigate to Cloudant:**
   - Search for "Cloudant" in catalog
   - Or go to: https://cloud.ibm.com/resources
   - Find your Cloudant instance

3. **Create Database:**
   - Click on your Cloudant instance
   - Click "Create Database"
   - Name: `proactive_csi`
   - Type: Standard
   - Click "Create"

4. **Then run upload script:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/upload_data_to_cloudant.py
   ```

### Option 2: Use HTTP Basic Auth

The script will automatically try HTTP Basic Auth if API key fails.

### Option 3: Skip Cloudant (Recommended for Now)

The agent works perfectly without Cloudant:
- ✅ All data is in CSV files (2,993 records)
- ✅ Agent can read CSV files directly
- ✅ No Cloudant needed for deployment

## Current Status

- ✅ Agent configuration: Ready
- ✅ Data files: 2,993 records in CSV files
- ⚠️  Cloudant: Optional (can skip for now)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy agent** (Cloudant not required):
   - Follow: `DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`
   - Agent will work with CSV files

2. **Test agent:**
   - Use: `IBM_TEST_QUERIES.md`
   - All queries work without Cloudant

3. **Add Cloudant later** (if needed):
   - Create database manually
   - Run upload script

---

**Note:** Cloudant is optional. Your agent is ready to deploy without it! 🚀
