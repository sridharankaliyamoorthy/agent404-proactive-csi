## Method 2 - Use cURL Command

Copy this command and replace `[TEXT]` with the briefing text:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -u "apikey:<REDACTED_TTS_API_KEY>" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"text":"[PASTE_BRIEFING_TEXT_HERE]"}' \
  --output executive_briefing.wav \
  "https://api.us-south.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/298e2b63-de83-427c-b97d-156c0976eed7/v1/synthesize?voice=en-US_MichaelV3Voice&accept=audio/wav"
```

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -u "apikey:<REDACTED_TTS_API_KEY>" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"text":"Good morning. This is your ProActive CSI daily executive briefing..."}' \
  --output executive_briefing.wav \
  "https://api.us-south.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/298e2b63-de83-427c-b97d-156c0976eed7/v1/synthesize?voice=en-US_MichaelV3Voice&accept=audio/wav"
```

## Method 3 - Direct API URL (Browser)

**Note:** This requires URL encoding the text, which can be complex. Use Method 1 or 2 instead.

## ✅ What the Agent Does

The agent:
1. ✅ Generates the audio via IBM TTS API (this works!)
2. ✅ Provides the full text content
3. ✅ Provides instructions on how to generate/download the audio

**The audio generation is working** - you just need to use one of the methods above to download it!
