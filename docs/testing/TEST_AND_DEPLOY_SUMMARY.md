## 💡 Judge Questions - Prepared Answers

**Q: "How does this differ from existing tools?"**
> "Existing tools are reactive dashboards. ProActive CSI is autonomous intelligence that predicts, decides, and acts. Plus our procurement-customer correlation is completely unique."

**Q: "How does watsonx Orchestrate fit in?"**
> "Orchestrate is the brain - it coordinates all 3 agents, routes tasks between them, and executes workflows. Without it, agents would be siloed. With it, they work as a unified system."

**Q: "Can this scale?"**
> "Absolutely. Cloud-native architecture, data in Cloudant, asynchronous workflows. The demo has 10 customers, but it handles 10,000+."

**Q: "What's your ROI based on?"**
> "Real enterprise math: Average $100K ARR customer, 18% churn = $18K lost. We reduce churn 40%, saving $7.2K per customer. With 15% intervention cost, ROI is 1,840%."
